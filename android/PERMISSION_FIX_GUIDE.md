# Fix: "Permission not granted. Download failed" Error

## 🚨 Problem

When clicking "Generate PDF" in the Android app (AppsGeyser or custom WebView app):
- Error message: "Permission not granted. Download failed"
- PDF doesn't download
- No file saved

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Android requires explicit storage permissions to save files.**

WebView apps need to:
1. Declare permissions in AndroidManifest.xml ✅ (Already done)
2. **Request runtime permissions** ❌ (Was missing)
3. Handle user's permission response
4. Only then save files

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Updated `MainActivity.java` to:
1. Check if storage permission is granted
2. If not granted → Request permission from user
3. Store PDF data while waiting for permission
4. After permission granted → Save and open PDF
5. If permission denied → Show clear error message

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### What Was Added:

**1. Permission State Variables:**
```java
private String pendingPdfBase64 = null;
private String pendingPdfFileName = null;
```
Stores PDF data while waiting for permission.

**2. Permission Check in `openPdfWithViewer()`:**
```java
if (permission not granted) {
    Store PDF data
    Request permission
    return  // Don't save yet
}
// Permission granted, proceed to save
```

**3. Permission Result Handler:**
```java
@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult() {
    if (permission granted) {
        Save pending PDF
        Open PDF
    } else {
        Show error message
        Clear pending data
    }
}
```

**4. Helper Methods:**
- `hasStoragePermission()` - Check if permission is available
- `requestStoragePermission()` - Request permission from JavaScript
- `savePdfFile()` - Separated save logic for reuse

## 📱 User Experience

### Before Fix:
```
User clicks "Generate PDF"
→ Error: "Permission not granted. Download failed" ❌
```

### After Fix:

**First Time (No Permission):**
```
1. User clicks "Generate PDF"
2. Toast: "Storage permission required to save PDF"
3. Android permission dialog appears:
   "Allow M.Pump Calc to access photos, media, and files?"
   [DENY] [ALLOW]
4. User taps "Allow"
5. Toast: "Permission granted! Saving PDF..."
6. PDF saved to /Downloads/MPumpCalc/
7. "Open with..." dialog appears
8. User selects PDF viewer
9. PDF opens ✅
```

**Subsequent Times (Permission Already Granted):**
```
1. User clicks "Generate PDF"
2. PDF saved immediately
3. "Open with..." dialog appears
4. PDF opens ✅
```

**If User Denies Permission:**
```
1. User clicks "Generate PDF"
2. Permission dialog appears
3. User taps "Deny"
4. Toast: "Permission denied. Cannot save PDF without storage permission."
5. PDF not saved (expected behavior)
```

## 🎯 How to Re-enable Permission

If user denied permission and wants to enable it later:

### Method 1: From App
1. Generate PDF again
2. Permission dialog will appear again
3. Tap "Allow"

### Method 2: From Android Settings
1. Settings → Apps → M.Pump Calc
2. Permissions → Storage
3. Toggle to "Allow"
4. Return to app
5. Generate PDF (will work immediately)

## 🔨 Building Updated APK

### Step 1: Verify Changes

Check that `/app/android/app/src/main/java/com/mpumpcalc/MainActivity.java` has:
- `PDF_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE` constant
- `pendingPdfBase64` and `pendingPdfFileName` variables
- Updated `openPdfWithViewer()` method with permission check
- `savePdfFile()` method
- `onRequestPermissionsResult()` method
- `hasStoragePermission()` and `requestStoragePermission()` methods

### Step 2: Build APK

**Using Android Studio:**
1. Open `/app/android` folder in Android Studio
2. Wait for Gradle sync
3. Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
4. Wait for build to complete
5. APK location: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

**Using Command Line:**
```bash
cd /app/android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Step 3: Install New APK

**On Phone:**
1. Uninstall old version:
   - Settings → Apps → M.Pump Calc → Uninstall
2. Install new APK
3. Open app
4. Test PDF generation

**Via USB:**
```bash
adb uninstall com.mpumpcalc.app
adb install app-debug.apk
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Permission Dialog Doesn't Appear

**Possible Causes:**
1. Permission already granted
2. Permission permanently denied
3. AndroidManifest.xml missing permissions

**Solutions:**
1. Check Settings → Apps → M.Pump Calc → Permissions
2. Clear app data or reinstall
3. Verify AndroidManifest.xml has:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

### Issue: Still Getting "Permission Denied" After Allowing

**Possible Causes:**
1. App not rebuilt with new code
2. Old APK still installed
3. Permission revoked in settings

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're running the NEW APK
2. Uninstall old version completely
3. Reinstall from the newly built APK
4. Check Settings → Apps → Permissions

### Issue: PDF Saves But Doesn't Open

**Possible Causes:**
1. No PDF viewer app installed
2. FileProvider issue

**Solutions:**
1. Install Google Drive PDF Viewer or Adobe Reader
2. Check FileProvider is configured in AndroidManifest.xml
3. Verify file_paths.xml exists

### Issue: App Crashes When Generating PDF

**Check Logs:**
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "mpump\|permission\|pdf"
```

**Common Issues:**
1. NullPointerException - Check variables are initialized
2. FileNotFoundException - Check folder creation
3. SecurityException - Check permissions

## 📊 Comparison

### AppsGeyser App (No Custom Code):
```
❌ No runtime permission handling
❌ Downloads fail with "Permission denied"
❌ Poor user experience
❌ No file access
```

### Custom Android App (Our Solution):
```
✅ Proper runtime permission handling
✅ Clear permission request dialog
✅ Automatic retry after permission granted
✅ "Open with..." integration
✅ Professional user experience
```

## 🔐 Android Permission System

### Permission Types:

**Install-time Permissions (Android 5.x and below):**
- Granted when app is installed
- No runtime request needed

**Runtime Permissions (Android 6.0+):**
- Must be requested at runtime
- User can grant or deny
- User can revoke later in Settings

**Dangerous Permissions:**
- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- Require runtime request on Android 6.0+

### Best Practices:

1. ✅ Request permission only when needed (when user clicks PDF)
2. ✅ Explain why permission is needed (toast message)
3. ✅ Handle denied permissions gracefully
4. ✅ Allow user to retry or continue without feature
5. ✅ Don't crash if permission denied

## 💡 Pro Tips

**1. Explain Permission Need:**
Show a dialog explaining why storage permission is needed before requesting:
```
"M.Pump Calc needs storage permission to save PDF reports to your device."
```

**2. Check Permission on App Start:**
Request permission on first app launch (optional):
```java
onCreate() {
    checkPermissions(); // Request early
}
```

**3. Provide Alternative:**
If permission denied, offer to:
- Share PDF via email/WhatsApp
- Copy PDF content to clipboard
- View report in browser

**4. Android 11+ (Scoped Storage):**
For Android 11+, consider using:
- MediaStore API (for Downloads folder)
- SAF (Storage Access Framework)
- App-specific directory (no permission needed)

**5. Test on Real Device:**
- Emulators sometimes behave differently
- Real device testing is essential
- Test on multiple Android versions

## 📝 Code Snippets

### Check if Permission is Granted (JavaScript):
```javascript
if (window.MPumpCalcAndroid && window.MPumpCalcAndroid.hasStoragePermission) {
    if (!window.MPumpCalcAndroid.hasStoragePermission()) {
        console.log("No storage permission");
        window.MPumpCalcAndroid.requestStoragePermission();
    }
}
```

### Request Permission Proactively:
```java
// In MainActivity onCreate()
if (!hasStoragePermission()) {
    requestStoragePermission();
}
```

## ✅ Final Checklist
