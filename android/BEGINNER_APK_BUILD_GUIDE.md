## 🎯 STEP 3: Get Your Android Project Files

You need to get the `/app/android/` folder from this project to your computer.

### Option A: Download from the platform

1. **Locate the download option** in your current environment

2. **Download the `/app/android/` folder** to your computer

3. **Save it somewhere easy to find** (like Desktop or Documents)

### Option B: If you have command line access

```bash
# Copy the entire android folder to a location accessible to your computer
# Example: if you have a shared folder or can download via git
```

### Important Files to Check:

Make sure your `android` folder contains:
```
android/
├── app/
├── gradle/
├── build.gradle
├── settings.gradle
├── local.properties
├── gradlew
└── gradlew.bat
```

---

## 🎯 STEP 4: Open Project in Android Studio

1. **Launch Android Studio**
   - Windows: Start Menu → Android Studio
   - Mac: Launchpad → Android Studio
   - Linux: Run `studio.sh`

2. **Welcome Screen appears** with options

3. **Click "Open"** button
   - It might also say "Open an Existing Project"

4. **File browser opens**
   - Navigate to where you saved the `android` folder
   - **Select the `android` folder** (the main folder, not the `app` subfolder)
   - Click **"OK"** or **"Open"**

5. **Android Studio starts loading the project**
   - You'll see a progress bar at the bottom
   - Text says "Gradle: Syncing..."
   - **This is normal - wait patiently!**

6. **First time opening may take 5-15 minutes** because:
   - Gradle downloads dependencies
   - Android SDK components download
   - Project indexes and builds

7. **Watch the bottom right corner:**
   - When it shows **"Gradle sync finished"** → Success! ✅
   - If it shows errors → See Troubleshooting section below

---

## 🎯 STEP 5: Configure Project (Important!)

Before building, you need to update one file:

### Update the Website URL:

1. **In Android Studio, left side panel** shows project files

2. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   app → java → com → mpumpcalc → MainActivity.java
   ```

3. **Double-click `MainActivity.java`** to open it

4. **Find line 45** (around there) that says:
   ```java
   private static final String APP_URL = "https://muro-alpha.vercel.app";
   ```

5. **Change it to your web app URL:**
   ```java
   private static final String APP_URL = "https://pumpcalc.preview.emergentagent.com";
   ```

6. **Save the file:**
   - Windows: `Ctrl + S`
   - Mac: `Cmd + S`
